Rebound for theâ€‚Vet: Alexander Volkanovski
Former UFC featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski has aâ€‚mission in front of him to plan his path back to the title after a turbulent time. At age 36, he canâ€™t afford many moreâ€‚challenges, let alone back-to-back knockout losses to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria. Despite these struggles, Volkanovski is optimisticâ€‚about his chances, due to his experience and tactical skill. It isnâ€™t just about individual accolades for him; he battles for his family, like his new baby on the way,â€‚and to silence skeptics.
Matt Evans: Volkanovski will needâ€‚to evade what Lopes brings early on with his footwork and slowly wear him down throughout. His aggressive style makes him dangerous, Lowrey said, but he understands that aggression can be a double edged sword that pains him if he gets reckless going for aâ€‚finish.

Diego Lopes, 30, has quickly climbed the featherweight ranks with aâ€‚five-fight winning streak. His path to this title fight started with bold guy decision to take a fight with theâ€‚blue chip prospect Movsar Evloev on short notice and do live with fight, and even lose it, my view is it put him on the radar. Lopes is aggressive and has knockout power but he also has a solid wresting background with 12â€‚submissions on his record.
That is the mentality that Lopes holds; he is someone who sees potential and isâ€‚willing to take risks. Heâ€‚sees this struggle as a perfect result of his effort and passion and he is confident to make the most of Volkanovski's recent weaknesses. Lopes most likely will try toâ€‚stick with his aggressive game plan, looking to catch Volkanovski with a big punch early in the bout.
The Clash of Styles
We have two opposites as styles here that is Volkanovski vs Lopes bothâ€‚have a very different approach towards fighting, Lopes being explosive, power oriented while Volkanovski on the tactical side. The result should hinge on whetherâ€‚Volkanovski is able to avoid Lopes' early flurries and capitalize on an opponent who may be looking to gas after a few rounds. On theâ€‚other hand, Lopes, if he can sustain the tempo and connect with a powerful blow having a knockout win that leaves with the belt.
The stakes are high for both fighters, with Volkanovski looking for redemption and Lopes, seeking his first UFCâ€‚title. The matchup is guaranteed to beâ€‚an exciting clash of generations and fighting philosophies.
